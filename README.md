# Sepdron-IDE
Sepdron trying to make a java IDE just because why not

I think I should also note that it's under copyright for now, 
because idk what license to pick, until i do that I'll probably be under copyright, 
as you might be able to tell, I also don't know the right way to say that this is copyrighted
